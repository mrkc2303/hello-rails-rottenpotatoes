### Guidelines

Homework is individual: you must complete the work on your own.
Learning from peers is great.
Copying from peers (or anyone / anywhere else) is grounds for failing the course due to academic dishonesty.
You should work using a code editor (e.g. VS Code) or an integrated development environment (e.g. AWS Cloud 9, RubyMine).
You must use Git for version control and store your solution in a repository on your academic GitHub account.
Put a link to your Heroku app that contains your solution in the README.md and add+commit+push it to your repository: git add . ; git commit -m "add heroku app address" ; git push.
Only the last commit before the assignment deadline will be graded.
Submit the URL of your GitHub repository to Canvas.
Late work is NOT accepted.
